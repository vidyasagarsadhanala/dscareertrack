    "## Capstone 1 Proposal – Predicting Lemon titles (Kicks) in Car Auctions\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "> To predict if the car purchased at the auction is a good/bad buy among thousands of cars purchased through online auctions. The goal is to create a machine learning model to predict the condition of the vehicle being purchased at a car auction, if it is a good/bad buy, hence reducing the risk.  \n",

    "#### Problem:\n",
    "> Predict if the car being purchased at auction is Good or Bad buy?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outcome:\n",
    ">One of the challenges for an auto dealership in purchasing a used car at an auction is the risk of that vehicle might have serious issues that prevent it from being resold. These are referred to as “kicks” or unfortunate purchases and are often resulting in a significant loss. Some examples of kicks could be tampered odometers, mechanical issues the dealer is not able to address, issues with getting the vehicle title from the seller or some unforeseen problem. Using machine learning to predict which cars have higher risk can provide real value to dealerships as they can predict kicks before the dealership buys at auctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset:\n",
    ">Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/DontGetKicked/data\n",
    "\n",
    ">Train set – 60%<br>\n",
    ">Test set – 40%\n",
    "\n",
    ">The data set contains information about each car, like purchase price, make and model, trim level, odometer reading, date of purchase, state of origin and so on. There are about 40 different variables (along with the lemon status indicator IsBadBuy) on around 72K cars, the test data set has the same information on around 40K cars. The target variable is “IsBadBuy” which is a binary variable and is a post-purchase classification for kicked on non-kicked cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation Metrics:\n",
    ">The evaluation metrics for this problem are going to be the Gini Index, Classification Accuracy %, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, and Log Loss metrics."
